# Homework 4 Writeup

  I think that pairing our discussion of *Device 6* with the discussion of Galloway's "Gamic Action" and diegesis was very interesting. It's a game that uses diegesis as a way to trick the player. Upon start, the experience is diegetically itentical to reading a book, but as the story progresses and the metalepsis reveals to the reader that the diagetic goes all the way up and out of the game. I was thinking about if this is something you could only achieve with in a video game. I think that "found footage" movies, like *The Blair Witch Project* have a similar role in their own medium. 
  The movie was supposedly filmed, lost, and then found in the woods. Since the movie itself exists within the "world" of *Blair Witch*, as do the people who find and watch the film, these movies also achieve roping the viewer into the diegesis in a similar way to *Device 6*. Obviously there is much less of a sense of agency that comes with watching *Blair Witch*, as the viewer can only decide to watch it or not watch it, so *Device 6* can be viewed as an evolution of these media pieces that seek to bleed into reality. 
  Another game that does this is, *Inscryption* which is kind of a "found footage video game," where the the game you are playing exists within the narrative. However, the difference with *Incryption* is that the game is being played by a in universe character, which you, the real life player, play as. So in *Inscryption*, despite the "found footage" format, there is a intermediary between the game world and the real world, meaning that it occupies a level of diagesis in between that of *Device 6* and a standard narrative.
